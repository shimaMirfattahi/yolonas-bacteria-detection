# YOLO-NAS Bacteria Detection

This project explores object detection using the YOLO-NAS model on a custom dataset of bacterial colonies.

## 🔍 Project Summary

- Compared YOLOv5, YOLOX, and YOLO-NAS for object detection
- Switched to YOLO-NAS for better performance on small datasets
- Used AWS S3 and SageMaker for experimentation
- Final implementation and training done locally using SuperGradients
